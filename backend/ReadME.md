```

## Getting Started

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/repo-reader.git
```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd repo-reader
```

3.  Install the required NPM packages for the client-side extension:

```
cd client
npm install
```

4.  Build the client-side extension:

```
npm run build
```

5.  Load the unpacked extension in Chrome by navigating to chrome://extensions and enabling Developer mode. 

### Usage

The project consists of two main components: a backend server and a client-side Chrome extension.

**Backend Server:**

The backend server is responsible for interacting with GitHub's API and Gemini 1.5 Pro.

1.  Start the backend server from the root directory:

```
python backend/app.py
```

This will initiate a Flask server running on your local machine, typically at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

**Client-Side Extension:**

The Chrome extension allows you to interact with the backend server. Once installed, click on the extension icon and choose the desired action.

*   **Generate ReadMe:** Clicking this button will send a message to the background script, which then retrieves the URL of the currently active tab. If the URL belongs to a public GitHub repository, it extracts the username and repository name and sends a POST request to the backend server (http://127.0.0.1:5000/readme). The backend processes the request, generates the ReadME using Gemini, and sends the ReadME back to the client. 
*   **Repo Chat:** (Under Development) This feature will provide a chat interface where you can ask questions about the repository and receive answers from Gemini. 

**File Structure and Interactions:**

Here's a breakdown of the file structure and how different files interact:

*   **backend/app.py:** This is the main Flask application file that defines the server's routes and handles incoming requests. 
*   **backend/gemini.py:** This file contains the functions that interact with the Gemini 1.5 Pro model. It defines functions for initializing the chat, sending messages, and generating ReadMEs.
*   **backend/gh\_api\_caller.py:** This file handles communication with the GitHub API. It fetches the repository's content and extracts relevant information.
*   **client/background.js:** This script runs in the background of the extension and listens for messages from the popup. It also handles communication with the backend server.
*   **client/index.tsx:** The entry point for the client-side extension, rendering the user interface.
*   **client/components/Home.tsx:** This component is responsible for displaying the main interface of the extension, including the buttons for generating ReadMEs and accessing the chat.
*   **client/components/AnimatedTextGradient.tsx:** Creates the animated gradient text effect used in the extension's UI.

## Deployment

This project is designed to run locally as a Chrome extension. 

To deploy the backend server to a live system, you would need to set up a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) and configure it to serve the Flask application. For the client-side extension, you would need to package it as a .crx file and publish it to the Chrome Web Store.

These instructions will guide you through setting up and running FactorLib on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/factorlib.git
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

#### Creating a Custom Factor

To create a custom factor, you need to create a class that inherits from the `BaseFactor` class. The `BaseFactor` class provides parallel processing functionality for creating custom factor datasets.

Here are the steps involved:

1. **Create a derived class:**
   - Define your class, inheriting from `BaseFactor`.
   - In the constructor, load and read all the raw data required for your factor calculation.
   - Merge all data into a single DataFrame and assign it to the `self.data` attribute.

2. **Implement the `generate_data` method:**
   - This static method is responsible for processing the data and generating the factor values.
   - It receives batches or slices of the `self.data` DataFrame.
   - Use helper functions (also static methods) for any intermediate calculations.

3. **(Optional) Override the `post_process` method:**
   - This method is called after parallel processing to perform any additional post-processing on the output DataFrames.
   - You can use it to concatenate the DataFrames or perform operations like reordering indices or setting column names.

4. **Generate the factor:**
   - Create an instance of your derived class.
   - Call the `generate_factor()` method to start the parallel processing and generate the factor data.

**Example:**

```python
from factorlib.base_factor import BaseFactor

class MyCustomFactor(BaseFactor):
    def __init__(self, name, data_dir):
        super().__init__(name, data_dir)
        # Load your raw data here
        self.data = ...  # Merge all data into a single DataFrame

    @staticmethod
    @ray.remote
    def generate_data(data, **kwargs):
        # Calculate your factor values here
        ...
        return factor_values

# Create an instance and generate the factor
my_factor = MyCustomFactor("my_factor", data_dir="./data")
my_factor.generate_factor()
```

#### Using a FactorModel

The `FactorModel` class is used to backtest quantitative trading strategies using factors. Here's how to use it:

1. **Create a FactorModel instance:**
   - Provide a name for your model, a list of tickers, and the desired interval (e.g., 'B' for business days).

2. **Add factors:**
   - Create `Factor` objects from your factor data.
   - Use the `add_factor()` method to add these factors to the model.

3. **Run walk-forward optimization (WFO):**
   - Provide the returns data, training interval, start and end dates, and other parameters to the `wfo()` method.
   - The model will perform WFO and generate performance statistics and plots.

**Example:**

```python
from factorlib.factor import Factor
from factorlib.factor_model import FactorModel

# Load factor data
factor_data = ...
returns_data = ...

# Create factors
factor1 = Factor("factor1", data=factor_data1)
factor2 = Factor("factor2", data=factor_data2)

# Create a FactorModel
model = FactorModel("my_model", tickers=["AAPL", "MSFT"], interval="B")

# Add factors to the model
model.add_factor(factor1)
model.add_factor(factor2)

# Run walk-forward optimization
stats = model.wfo(returns_data, train_interval=pd.DateOffset(years=5), start_date=..., end_date=...)
```

## Getting Started

Factorlib offers a structured approach to factor creation and analysis. Here's a breakdown of the key files and their functionalities:

*   **factorlib/base\_factor.py:** The `BaseFactor` class provides a foundation for creating custom factors with parallel processing capabilities. You'll inherit from this class and override the `generate_data` method to define your factor's logic.

*   **factorlib/factor.py:** The `Factor` class represents a single factor and handles data formatting and transformations before it's used in a `FactorModel`.

*   **factorlib/factor\_model.py:** The `FactorModel` class manages a collection of factors and facilitates model training, prediction, and walk-forward optimization.

*   **factorlib/stats.py:** The `Statistics` class provides tools for calculating and presenting performance metrics and insights, such as information coefficient, Sharpe ratio, and drawdown analysis.

*   **scripts/data/cleaner.py:** This script demonstrates data cleaning and preprocessing techniques, particularly relevant for preparing factor data from sources like Open Asset Pricing.

*   **system\_test.py:** This script provides an example of how to use Factorlib's components together to create a factor model, perform walk-forward optimization, and analyze results.

### Usage

1.  **Define Custom Factors:** Create a new Python file and define your custom factor class by inheriting from `BaseFactor`. Implement the `generate_data` method to specify your factor's calculation logic.

2.  **Create Factor Instances:** Instantiate your custom factor class and any other pre-built factors you want to include in your model using the `Factor` class.

3.  **Build a Factor Model:** Create a `FactorModel` object, providing a name, tickers, and the desired model type (e.g., LightGBM).

4.  **Add Factors to the Model:** Use the `add_factor` method of the `FactorModel` to incorporate your factor instances into the model.

5.  **Walk-Forward Optimization:** Call the `wfo` method of the `FactorModel` to perform walk-forward optimization. Specify parameters like the training interval, start and end dates, and portfolio construction settings.

6.  **Analyze Results:** The `wfo` method returns a `Statistics` object, which provides various methods for analyzing and visualizing the performance of your factor model, including Sharpe ratio, drawdown analysis, and information coefficient.

## Deployment

Factorlib is primarily intended for research and development purposes. It provides a framework for creating and evaluating quantitative factors but does not include specific deployment mechanisms for live trading systems. Integrating Factorlib-generated factors into production environments would require additional engineering efforts and considerations specific to the trading platform and infrastructure.

## Usage

factorlib is composed of 4 main modules:

*   factorlib/base\_factor.py
*   factorlib/factor.py
*   factorlib/factor\_model.py
*   factorlib/stats.py

### base\_factor.py

This file is responsible for creating custom factors with parallel processing.  To do so you would create a derived class from the `BaseFactor` class and implement the `generate_data` method, and optionally implement the `post_process` method to do additional post-processing to the resulting factor.  

The `BaseFactor` class takes several parameters:

*   `name`: str. The name of the factor.
*   `splice_size`: int. The size of each splice.
*   `batch_size`: int. The number of slices in each batch.
*   `splice_by`: factorlib.types.SpliceBy.  This determines the index with which to group by when creating splices.
*   `rolling`: int.  The size of the rolling window.  If set to 0 there will be no rolling window.
*   `general_factor`: bool.  A factor is a general factor if the data is the same for every ticker. 
*   `tickers`: list\[str\]. A list of tickers to multiply the data across if the factor is a general\_factor. Unused if general\_factor == False.
*   `data_dir`: pathlib.Path. The output directory of the output file. This should be the directory that holds all of your factors.

After creating your custom class you would call the `generate_factor()` method to create the factor and save it to disk.

### factor.py

The factor file is responsible for formatting user input data and transforming it for use in a factor model.

The `Factor` class takes several parameters:

*   `name`: str. The name of the factor.

*   `general_factor`: bool. True if this factor is a general factor for all tickers. 
*   `transforms`: list\[any\]. A list of functions or functors that will perform transforms on the data.
*   `transform_columns`: list\[str\]. A list of columns for which the transforms should be applied.
*   `categorical`: list\[str\]. The columns that should be considered as categorical variables for XGBoost during walk-forward optimization.

### factor\_model.py

This is where you create your factor model. To use this file you first create a `FactorModel` object and then add factors to it by calling the `add_factor()` method.  

The `FactorModel` class takes several parameters:

*   `name`: str. The name of the model.
*   `tickers`: list\[str\]. A list of tickers to use for the model.
*   `interval`: str. The desired interval of the time series.
*   `model_type`: factorlib.types.ModelType. The type of model to use for walk-forward optimization. 
*   `load_path`: pathlib.Path. The path to load a saved model from.

The `add_factor()` method takes two parameters:

*   `factor`: factorlib.Factor.  The factor object to add to the model.
*   `replace`: bool.  Whether to replace existing columns with the same name as columns in the factor being added.

Once you have created your model and added factors to it, you can perform walk-forward optimization by calling the `wfo()` method.

The `wfo()` method takes several parameters:

*   `returns`: pd.DataFrame. A dataframe of returns for each ticker.
*   `train_interval`: pd.DateOffset. The length of the training interval.
*   `start_date`: datetime.datetime. The date to start the walk-forward optimization.
*   `end_date`: datetime.datetime. The date to end the walk-forward optimization.
*   `anchored`: bool. Whether to use an anchored walk-forward optimization.

*   `port_opt`: factorlib.types.PortOptOptions. The type of portfolio optimization to use.
*   `pred_time`: str. The time step to predict.
*   `train_freq`: str. The frequency to train the model.
*   `candidates`: dict. A dictionary of candidates for each date.
*   `calc_training_ic`: bool. Whether to calculate the training information coefficient.
*   `save_dir`: pathlib.Path. The directory to save the model and statistics to.

Once you have called `wfo()`, the `factorlib.stats.Statistics` object will be returned.

### stats.py

The stats file is responsible for calculating and displaying statistics for the factor model.

The `Statistics` class takes several parameters:

   - Override the `generate_data()` method to implement your factor logic.
   - Load and preprocess raw data in the constructor.
   - Merge all data into a single DataFrame assigned to `self.data`.

2. **Instantiate your factor class:**
   - Provide the factor name, splice size, batch size, and other parameters.

3. **Generate the factor data:**
   - Call the `generate_factor()` method to initiate parallel processing.

```python
from factorlib.base_factor import BaseFactor

class MyFactor(BaseFactor):
    def __init__(self, name, data_dir):
        super().__init__(name, data_dir=data_dir)
        # Load and preprocess data here...
        self.data = ...  # Merged DataFrame

    @staticmethod
    @ray.remote
    def generate_data(data, **kwargs):
        # Implement factor logic here...
        return processed_data

# Example usage
my_factor = MyFactor("my_factor", data_dir=Path("./data/factors"))
my_factor.generate_factor()
```

#### Building a Factor Model

1. **Create a FactorModel instance:**
   - Provide the model name, tickers, and interval.
   - Optionally specify the model type (e.g., `ModelType.lightgbm`).

2. **Add factors to the model:**
   - Use the `add_factor()` method to incorporate factors created using BaseFactor.

3. **Perform walk-forward optimization:**
   - Pass returns data, training interval, start/end dates, and other parameters to the `wfo()` method.
   - This will train the model iteratively and generate performance statistics.

```python
from factorlib.factor_model import FactorModel
from factorlib.factor import Factor

# Example usage
returns = ...  # Load returns data
factor1 = ...  # Create factor 1 using BaseFactor
factor2 = ...  # Create factor 2 using BaseFactor

model = FactorModel("my_model", tickers=..., interval="B")
model.add_factor(factor1)
model.add_factor(factor2)

stats = model.wfo(returns, train_interval=pd.DateOffset(years=5), ...)
```

#### Analyzing Results

- **Access statistics:** Use the `Statistics` object returned by `wfo()` to retrieve performance metrics.
- **Generate reports:** Call the `stats_report()` method to print a summary of statistics.
- **Visualize results:** Use QuantStats and SHAP for plotting and analysis.

```python
# Example usage
stats.stats_report()
stats.snapshot()  # Generate QuantStats performance tearsheet
stats.beeswarm_shaps(period=0)  # Visualize SHAP values for the first period
```

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/SortAlgoBenchmarking.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd SortAlgoBenchmarking
   ```



## Usage

### File Organization:
The codebase is organized into several Python files, each with a specific role:

*   **sort\_algorithms.py:** Contains implementations of various sorting algorithms, such as bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, and selection sort.
*   **benchmark.py:** The main script that runs the benchmarking process. It generates random arrays of different sizes, applies each sorting algorithm to these arrays, measures the execution time, and collects the results. 
*   **visualization.py:** Provides functions for creating visual representations of the benchmarking results using Matplotlib. This helps in comparing the performance of the algorithms more intuitively.

### Running the Benchmark:

1.  From the command line, execute the `benchmark.py` script:

    ```sh
    python benchmark.py
    ```

    This will run the benchmarking process and display the results, including execution times for each algorithm and different input sizes.
2.  To generate visualizations of the results, run the `visualization.py` script:

    ```sh
    python visualization.py
    ```

    This will create plots that compare the performance of the algorithms visually.

## Deployment

This project is primarily intended for local development and experimentation. However, the code can be easily adapted for deployment on cloud platforms or integration into larger data analysis workflows.

# Oregon Trail

The game is a text-based adventure game that simulates the experience of traveling the Oregon Trail in the 19th century. Players must make decisions about resource management, travel, and survival as they attempt to reach Oregon from Missouri. The game includes random events such as illness, accidents, and encounters with Native Americans, which can affect the player's progress and health. 

### Features

-   Simulates the experience of traveling the Oregon Trail. 
-   Make decisions about resource management, travel, and survival.
-   Includes random events.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.7 or higher is required to run the game. 
*   You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
*   The game uses the following Python libraries:
    *   random 
    *   time
    *   sys

## Getting Started 

To play the game, simply clone or download the repository and run the 'oregon_trail.py' file. 

### Installation 

1.  Clone the repo
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/Oregon-Trail.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory 
    ```
    cd Oregon-Trail 
    ```
3.  Run the game 
    ``` 
    python oregon_trail.py
    ``` 

## Usage

The codebase for the Oregon Trail game is organized into several files, each with its own specific purpose. 

*   **oregon\_trail.py**: This is the main file that runs the game. It contains the game loop, which handles player input, updates the game state, and displays information to the player. 
*   **events.py**: This file contains the code for the different random events that can occur during the game, such as illnesses, accidents, and encounters with Native Americans. 
*   **locations.py**: This file contains the data for the different locations that the player can visit along the trail, including their names, descriptions, and distances from each other. 
*   **store.py**: This file contains the code for the store, where the player can buy and sell supplies. 
*   **wagon.py**: This file contains the code for the player's wagon, which tracks the player's supplies, health, and other stats. 

To start the game, simply run the 'oregon\_trail.py' file. The game will begin by asking the player to enter their name and the names of their party members. The player will then be presented with a series of choices, such as what supplies to buy, when to rest, and which route to take. The game will continue until the player either reaches Oregon or dies along the way.
